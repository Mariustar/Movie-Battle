**[Movie Battle](https://mariustar-movie-battle.surge.sh)**

First time working with an API (tmdb). It was quite the journey and I enjoyed it very much.
If I come up with some more ideas I will implement them in the future.

Features:

- Search for two movies on both sides.
- You will get a list of movie stats and compare them between the two movies and viasually see which is better.
- Clicking on image directs you to the official IMDB page of that movie.
- On top of the image we got a trailer button which directs you to the Youtube trailer of that movie.
